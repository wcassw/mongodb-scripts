/**
 * Once you have downloaded this file, you may need to change some of the 
 * backup settings.
 *
 * By default, this script will rsync your files to a designated backup 
 * directory. It will automatically determine the data directory of the 
 * current mongo node.
 *
 * @example Run the script from the shell
 *  mongo backup.js
 *
 * @example run the script against a MongoDb node on a different port
 *  mongo --port 27017 backup.js
 *
 *
 * If you attempt to run it against a replica set primary node, the backup 
 * script will tell you and exit. Running it against a single node will sill 
 * prompt you a warning, but continue to lock the database and backup.
